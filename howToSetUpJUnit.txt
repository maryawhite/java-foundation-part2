1. Set up a new Java project in IntelliJ
2. Go ahead and create your first class and include some properties and methods
3. Place your cursor on the same line as the class name, and control click or control return, then select Generate, and generate Test
or, select the Code tab and Generate test.
4. You might get a pop up that says "No Test Roots Found, Create test in the same source root". Click OK
5. Then, you should get a pop up with some options.
From the dropdown menu, select JUnit 4, on the warning "JUnit 4 library not found in the module", click "FIX"
Check the boxes for setup/Before and tearDown/After and click whichever methods you want to test
If you didn't click FIX, go to File -- Project Structure -- Libraries -- click the plus + -- From Maven -- search for JUnit 4, most recent version
6. Go to File -- Project Structure -- Modules, and make sure the JUnit says compile for the scope, not Test
